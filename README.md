# Hotel-Booking-Analysis-capston-python-project
The project is explaining about the capston project of Hotel Booking analysis. here the data is about customer booking information.The purpose of this exploratory data analysis (EDA) was to explore the hotel booking data set and identify potential relationships between key variables.As part of the analysis, descriptive statistics were calculated for each variable, and visualizations were created to explore the relationships between various variables. To get insight from the dataset, we built a variety of charts, including a count plot, bar plot, kdeplot, heatmap, pairplot, violin plot, and boxplot.
The data set was composed of over 119390 hotel bookings, each containing several variables such as 'hotel', 'is_canceled', 'lead_time', For this hotel booking analysis, the goal was to explore the customer data of a hotel and identify any potential trends or correlations. The purpose of this exploratory data analysis (EDA) was to explore the hotel booking data set and identify potential relationships between key variables. The data set included customer booking information. As part of the analysis, descriptive statistics were calculated for each variable, and visualizations were created to explore the relationships between various variables. To get insight from the'arrival_date_year', 'arrival_date_month', 'arrival_date_week_number', 'arrival_date_day_of_month', 'stays_in_weekend_nights', 'stays_in_week_nights', 'adults', 'children', 'babies', 'meal', 'country', 'market_segment', 'distribution_channel', 'is_repeated_guest', 'previous_cancellations', 'previous_bookings_not_canceled', 'reserved_room_type', 'assigned_room_type', 'booking_changes', 'deposit_type', 'agent', 'company', 'days_in_waiting_list', 'customer_type', 'adr', 'required_car_parking_spaces', 'total_of_special_requests', 'reservation_status', and 'reservation_status_date'.
We faced some issues with the data when we were cleaning and analyzing it. There were a lot of duplicate values in the dataset. Null values were present in the dataset. Choosing the most effective visualization method is difficult. Performing feature engineering was more challenging.
